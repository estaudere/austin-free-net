## Requirements

Ensure you have Ionic [installed](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli). If you would like to
develop on a simulator, download the latest version of Xcode (Ionic apps can also be run on a
web browser). If you would like to test on a physical device, ensure the device is completely up 
to date and compatible with the version of Xcode that you have downloaded.

## Running

### Simulator or device

IN PROGRESS: Avoid running on a simulator or device through Xcode until development is finished.

### Web browser

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Run `ionic serve` to automatically open the app in a
web browser as a website. Open the developer tools console in your web browser to resize to typical
phone dimensions (in Chrome, the button can be found in the top left corner of the developer tools 
pane).
